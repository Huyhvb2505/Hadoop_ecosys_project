CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE employees_ext (
    employee_id INT,
    first_name STRING,
    last_name STRING,
    email STRING,
    department STRING,
    salary DOUBLE,
    hire_date DATE
)

5. **optimization_report.md** - Discussion of partitioning and performance (minimum 300 words)
6. **reflection.md** - Learning outcomes and challenges (minimum 200 words)

## Grading Rubric

| Component | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Task 2.1 | 25 | Tables created correctly with proper schemas |
| Task 2.2 | 30 | Data loaded successfully with ETL transformations |
| Task 2.3 | 35 | All complex queries executed with correct results |
| Task 2.4 | 10 | Partitioning implemented and explained |
| **Total** | **100** | |

## Tips for Success

1. **Query Optimization**: Use EXPLAIN PLAN to understand query execution
2. **Data Validation**: Always verify row counts after data loading
3. **Error Handling**: Check Hive logs if queries fail
4. **Performance**: Monitor query execution time for optimization opportunities

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Table Not Found**: Ensure you're in the correct database
2. **Permission Errors**: Check HDFS permissions for data files
3. **Memory Issues**: Increase container memory if queries fail
4. **Date Format**: Ensure date formats match your data
